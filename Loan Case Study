The project is about analyzing the Loan case study
dataset. The Project involves 2 data sets. Where 1st dataset represents the previous
application of the customers which has a detailed information about the customers
like education, job title, housing type etc. It also includes purpose of loan and
loan status whether approved, rejected, cancelled or unused offer. The 2nd dataset
represents new loan application which also include detailed information about the
customers like education, job title, housing type etc. It also includes a target
column which represents whether the customer earlier applied was a defaulter or
